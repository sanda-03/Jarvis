This is Jarvis, a python program made to automatize stuffs. Like closing and opening applications, google search, youtube search, playing music

And it has integrated AI. As for the model, I used Gemini 2.5 flash model, which is free. So yeah, you can ask any questions to Jarvis,
and it will answer accordingly.
