This is Jarvis, a python program made to automatize stuffs. Like closing and opening applications, google search, youtube search, playing music and much more. 

And it has integrated AI. As for the model, I used Gemini 2.5 flash model, which is free. So yeah, you can ask any questions to Jarvis, and it will answer accordingly.

As for playing music, it needs to done manually in musiclibrary.py

Limitations- 
1.The AI model is not upto date so you might get some outdated info, like you might ask 'Who won the Club World Cup 2025?', It will give a unusual response, as its date is somewhere stuck in 2024.

2.It still needs a lot of work.
